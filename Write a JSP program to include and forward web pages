To demonstrate including and forwarding web pages in a JSP program, you can use <jsp:include> and <jsp:forward> actions. These actions allow you to include or forward the content of one JSP page to another. Below is an example that illustrates how to use these actions effectively.

Step 1: Create JSP Files
Let's create three JSP files in your web application directory (webapp folder):

index.jsp: The main JSP file that includes or forwards other pages.
includedPage.jsp: A JSP file that will be included in the main page.
forwardedPage.jsp: A JSP file that will be forwarded from the main page.
1. index.jsp
jsp
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Main Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Main Page</h1>

    <!-- Include another JSP page -->
    <jsp:include page="includedPage.jsp" />

    <!-- Forward the request to another JSP page -->
    <jsp:forward page="forwardedPage.jsp" />
</body>
</html>
2. includedPage.jsp
jsp
Copy code
<p>This is the included page. You are seeing this content because it's included in the main page.</p>
3. forwardedPage.jsp
jsp
Copy code
<p>This page has been forwarded from the main page. You should not see this directly.</p>
Step 2: Accessing the Main Page
Access the index.jsp file in your web browser (e.g., http://localhost:8080/your-web-app-name/index.jsp). This will execute the index.jsp file, which in turn includes the content of includedPage.jsp and forwards the request to forwardedPage.jsp.

Explanation:
index.jsp: This is the main JSP file that includes or forwards other pages. It uses <jsp:include> to include the content of includedPage.jsp directly into the main page. It also uses <jsp:forward> to forward the request to forwardedPage.jsp, meaning the content of forwardedPage.jsp will replace the content of index.jsp in the browser.
includedPage.jsp: This JSP file contains simple content that will be included within the index.jsp page. The content of this page will be visible directly on the index.jsp page.
forwardedPage.jsp: This JSP file contains content that will replace the index.jsp content when the forward action is executed. You will not see this page directly in the browser, but its content will replace the index.jsp content.
Notes:
Use <jsp:include> to dynamically include the content of another JSP page within the current JSP page. This is useful for reusable components or modules.
Use <jsp:forward> to forward the request to another JSP page. The response from the forwarded page replaces the response from the current page.
Ensure that your servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) is running and your web application is deployed correctly.
Customize and enhance this example based on your requirements, such as passing parameters to included or forwarded pages, handling request attributes, or implementing more complex logic in the JSP files.
