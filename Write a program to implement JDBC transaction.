Implementing JDBC transactions in Java allows you to manage a series of database operations as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that all operations either commit successfully as a whole or roll back (undo) if any operation fails. Below is a detailed specification along with example code demonstrating how to use JDBC transactions to execute database operations within a transaction in Java.

JDBC Transaction Specification:
Establish Connection: Connect to the database using DriverManager.getConnection().
Set Auto-Commit to False: Disable auto-commit mode on the connection using connection.setAutoCommit(false) to start a transaction.
Create and Execute SQL Statements: Execute multiple SQL statements (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) within the transaction.
Commit or Roll Back: After executing all statements, decide to commit the transaction (connection.commit()) or roll back the transaction (connection.rollback()) based on the outcome of operations.
Handle Exceptions: Properly handle any exceptions that may occur during the transaction.
Example Code:
Here's an example Java class that demonstrates using JDBC transactions to perform database operations within a transaction in Java:

java
Copy code
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class JDBCTransactionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection connection = null;
        PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;

        try {
            // Step 1: Establish connection
            String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_db";
            String username = "username";
            String password = "password";
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

            // Step 2: Disable auto-commit to start a transaction
            connection.setAutoCommit(false);

            // Step 3: Create and execute SQL statements within the transaction
            String sqlInsert = "INSERT INTO employees (name, age, position) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
            preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sqlInsert);
            preparedStatement.setString(1, "John Doe");
            preparedStatement.setInt(2, 30);
            preparedStatement.setString(3, "Manager");
            preparedStatement.executeUpdate();

            // Simulate an error by dividing by zero to trigger a SQLException
            int x = 10 / 0;

            // If no exception occurs, commit the transaction
            connection.commit();
            System.out.println("Transaction committed successfully!");

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Transaction failed! Rolling back...");
            e.printStackTrace();
            try {
                // Roll back the transaction if any error occurs
                if (connection != null) {
                    connection.rollback();
                }
            } catch (SQLException ex) {
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }
        } finally {
            // Step 5: Close resources and restore auto-commit mode
            try {
                if (preparedStatement != null) {
                    preparedStatement.close();
                }
                if (connection != null) {
                    connection.setAutoCommit(true); // Restore auto-commit mode
                    connection.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
Step 1: Establish a connection to the MySQL database by providing the JDBC URL (url), username, and password to DriverManager.getConnection().
Step 2: Disable auto-commit mode on the connection using connection.setAutoCommit(false) to start a transaction.
Step 3: Execute SQL statements (e.g., INSERT) within the transaction using PreparedStatement.executeUpdate().
Step 4: Handle exceptions (SQLException) within a try-catch block. If any exception occurs during the transaction, roll back (connection.rollback()) to undo changes.
Step 5: Close the PreparedStatement and Connection objects in the finally block. Restore auto-commit mode (connection.setAutoCommit(true)) and close the connection.
Notes:
Replace localhost:3306/employee_db with your MySQL database host, port, and database name.
Replace "username" and "password" with your MySQL database credentials.
The example intentionally triggers a SQLException by dividing by zero (int x = 10 / 0;) to demonstrate transaction rollback.
Use JDBC transactions to ensure that a series of database operations either commit as a whole or roll back if any operation fails.
